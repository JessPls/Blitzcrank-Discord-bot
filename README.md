# Blitzcrank-Discord-bot
A Discord bot that provides some basic QoL features like polling, as well as some more entertaining features.

Blitzcrank (name subject to change) is a Discord bot that covers basic functionality such as simple polling, choosing, rolling a die,
generating a random number, etc. Blitzcrank will hopefully have more complex functionality in the future.

Please use the following steps to set up Blitzcrank in your own server:
 - Set up a bot account on Discord at this link: https://discord.com/developers/applications
 - Make sure you add the bot to the server you want it in
 - Reveal your bot's token and copy this value for later
 - Make sure you have Node.js downloaded
 - Download this repository and put it into a folder on your Desktop, Documents, etc.
 - Open up the index.js file in an IDE of your choosing and change the value of the "TOKEN" constant to your bot's token
 - Open up Terminal (Mac) or Command Prompt (Windows)
 - Navigate to the folder that you put this repository's contents in (use the cd command)
 - Input "node run index.js" in Terminal/Command Prompt
 - The bot should be working in your Discord, go try it out!

To see all of the commands that the bot has, use the "!commands" command.

Enjoy!
